/*
 * Run - three or more cards in a row of the same suit (straight flush). Not limited to 5 cards.
 * Set - three or four cards of the same rank (three/four of a kind)
 * Meld - term for sets and runs (ex. 3 melds, made up of 2 sets and 1 run)
 *
 * Setting up rounds
 * - each player is dealt 10 cards (2 players, more players may mean fewer cards); remaining deck is placed in the
 * center, and one card is drawn to make the discard pile
 * - first action - non-dealer decides if they want the face up card. If they pass, the dealer has the option to take
 *  it. If the dealer passes as well, player 2 will draw from the deck.
 *
 * Turn
 * - each turn - player can draw from either the face-up or face-down pile. If drawing from face-down, player can
 * decide to discard to face-up or their hand. If a player takes a card for their hand, they must also discard
 * something.
 *
 * Knocking
 * - round ends when a player knocks, and can only knock when their unmatched cards (deadwood) add up to 10 or less
 * - scores are based on unmatched player cards
 * - if the knocking player has a lower deadwood score than their opponent, they are awarded the difference to their
 * score.
 * - When a player knocks, the other player may play their unmatched cards against the knocker's matched cards (the
 * layoff). This occurs before dealing score. Knocking player cannot lay off cards. Layoffs cannot be applied to
 * unmatched cards.
 * - if the knocking player has an equal or higher deadwood score than their opponent, the opponent gets the difference
 *  as well as a 25(10? 20? idk) point bonus (undercut)
 * - in short, the player with the lower(or equal if they didn't knock) deadwood is awarded the difference. If the
 * winning player didn't knock, they also get a 25(10?) point bonus.
 *
 * Going Gin
 * - round can also end by going gin
 * - going gin means having every card in hand as a part of a meld. No layoffs allowed.
 * - player with gin gets the value of opponents unmatched cards in addition to a 25(20?) point bonus
 * - if the draw deck gets down to 2 cards without a knock, the round is void
 *
 * if deck gets down to 2 cards, the round is void and ends.
 *
 * Win Conditions
 * - first player to 100 points wins
